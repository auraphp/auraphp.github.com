We have released Aura.Autoload, Aura.Cli, Aura.Di, Aura.Intl, Aura.Uri 
and Aura.View. All the changes have been documented in the changes.txt in
the appropriate packages. Many thanks to the contributors 
(@nakymaton, @mapthegod, @dhaaker, @koriym, @pborreli, @JeremyKendall) who made this release happen.

One of the notable change is for Aura.Uri, which now supports PublicSuffixList.
Many thanks to [Jeremy Kendall](https://github.com/JeremyKendall) and he is joining the team.
Please welcome him.

We have a brand new website, and also the domain
now points to auraphp.com than auraphp.github.com. 
Many thanks to Paul M Jones for working behind the release, website changes 
and for his hard work behind all.

We will be releasing other packages also shortly, which includes the new 
shiny Aura.Input (form component)

Nb: If I missed to give any credits please ping me.
